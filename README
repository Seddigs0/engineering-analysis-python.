Engineering Stability Analysis 

This project is a simplified engineering analysis workflow using Python. 
Where the code computes a basic factor of safety slope using the limit equilibrium method
and creating a plot which shows how the factor of safety changes with friction angle for a given slope.


Features: 
- The numerical computation of the factor of safety
- Parameter sensitivity analysis on the friction angle
- The visualization of the stability trends using a graph (matplotlib).

Technologies: 
- Python
- Numerical Methods
- Engineering modeling concepts

Purpose: 
Created to demonstrate engineering-focused coding and numerical reasoning related to 
the software used in geotechnical and engineering analysis.
